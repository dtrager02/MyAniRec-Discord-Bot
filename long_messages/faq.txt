**Q:** How does it work?
**A:** Short Answer: A machine learning model developed by Netflix called MultVAE, a data management system called Redis, and a discord bot written in Python, and a distributed ML server running using Ray Serve. As far as I know, it is the first anime recommender system of this scale.
Long Answer, the model driving the system uses a Variational Autoencoder to learn the latent features of each item. It does so basically by feeding in over 50 million anime lists, calculating how closely the model predicted the items you watched, and updating the model to optimize its predictions. When you use the bot, every anime you input is fed into the model, and the model outputs a ranking for every other anime you haven't seen. The model is still in development, and I am constantly working on improving it. One strength of it is how efficient it is, and how it is user-agnostic, meaning it does not require any user-specific data to make a prediction. This allows it to instantly make a prediction for new users without any kind of clustering. Another unique strength of MultVae is how resistant it is to overfitting. It performs well even with heavy dropout, and uses KL divergence in the loss to regularize the distribution of the model latent representation. The model architecture itself is pretty complex, so it was copied from the original authors, but the training loop, data processing, and data loader are all custom and heavily optimized, to the point that a model can be trained in about 15 minutes on Google Colab Pro.

**Q:** What anime should I add?
**A:**Add shows you **enjoyed**. Adding shows that you watched but meant nothing to you or shows you disliked will only hurt the performance of the current model. Also, very rarely, adding strange combinations of shows, such as only season 4's with no season 1's sometimes lead to unpredictable results.

**Q:** Where are the new anime?
**A:** This bot aims to have recommendations for all shows **up to the previous completed season.** Basically, the model behind this recommender system is enormous, and I cannot afford to update it every day as new shows and new ratings come out, nor would that be effective given how ratings change drastically throughout the season.

**Q:** I found a bug, what do I do?
**A:** Message NoSkillOrHacks#9465 on discord, and we can work through it together. Otherwise, just use the `.feedback` command to let me know.

**Q:** Why am I getting terrible Recommendations?
**A:** (Copium warning) There are many weaknesses of this kind of Recommender System. It struggles when a list contains very unpopular items, oritems that do not make sense to be together (e.g. seeing season 3 and 4 of a show, but not season 1). If you take the time to tune your list with the bot commands, it will definitely give better output. However, there is more. The model is only as good as the data it is fed.MyAnimeList, the website which I pulled over 50M users' public data from, has had issues historically with bots, review bombers, and other malicious accounts. This kind of data obviously hurts the performance of the model. I did my best with common sense to filter out these users, but there is a very good chance a lot were still in the data. Also, unlike most recommender systems you are used to where trending shows float to the top, this one (intentionally) has no inherent popularity filter, so that people can be exposed to various shows without bias. Compared to the top shows you usually hear about, there are at least 10 times more unheard-of, and especially outdated shows. This means, by random chance, animes that nobody has ever heard of will end up at the top of therecommendations. That's just how probability works. Of course, some of these problems can be worked on, and I plan to keep updating the project. Overall, I am happy with its recommendations so far.

**Q:** Will the bot remember by information?
**A:** As long as you use the same discord account, yes. All your information is tied to your discord account, and none will be deleted when you are offline.
