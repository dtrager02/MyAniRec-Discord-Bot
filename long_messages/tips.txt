**Timeouts:** For 'heavy' commands like `/rec complete` and `/mal set`, you must wait **3 seconds** between each command. )
Most other commands will have virtually  no limit, so spam away.
For some other commands that involve multiple inputs, the bot will stop waiting for inputs after **6 minutes**. Youalways restart the command if you need to.
**Saving:** The bot will remember all your input, so no need to repeat old commands unless you want to change something.
**Commands:** <> indicates a required input, [] indicates an optional input*. You do not need to literally input symbols. All unrequired input will be ignored.
`/mal set <username>`: Set your MAL username. This will load all of your completed anime into the system and is much eathan typing them in one by one.
`/mal remove`: Delete all your MAL data. If you use this, the anime you manually entered with the /rec command will still be there, so it is useful if you like manual tuning without MAL.
`/rec add <anime_title>`: Add an anime to your list. Follow the directions in the bot's response. You will be able to add multiple at once by inputting the numbers separated by spaces.
`/rec remove <anime_title>`: Remove an anime from your list. Follow the directions in the bot's response. Due to the way the bot works, there is no way to remove an anime from a linked MAL account. If you don't like certain ratings in your MAL, do `/mal remove` and manually add them back with `/rec add`, or simply update your MAL account.
`/rec complete`: Get recommendations. Follow the directions in the bot's response to see more pages of recommendations.
`/rec clear`: Remove all your added anime. Does not remove MAL-related data.
`/rec lang <en/jp>`: Change default language of recommendations
`/list`: Lists all the data the bot has on you. This is useful for making sure you are ready before `/rec complete`.[split]
`/tips`: Shows this message.
`/faq`: Shows frequently asked questions and background info about this bot.
`/info`: Shows a short description of the bot and how to use it.
`/myids`: Shows all MAL anime ids that the bot has on you. This is useful for debugging.
`/feedback`: Give feedback to the bot creators. Make sure to use quotes.
`/choose <number>`: Select a recommendation that you plan to watch, or one you like the most. This will help the ML algorithm improve in the future.
